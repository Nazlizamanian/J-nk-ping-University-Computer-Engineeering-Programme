# Jönköping-University-Computer-Engineeering-Programme

# About the programme
The first year of the program is primarily dedicated to foundational courses in programming, aimed at providing students with a fundamental basic understanding of both programming and mathematics. The second year is centered around the specialization in software development and mobile platforms.
The education is largely based on projects and exercises that provide practical experience of the techniques being taught. Projects can span across multiple courses: in one course, you might build a user interface for a mobile app, then in the next course, construct its data storage, and in a third course, work on its network functionality. This approach offers a holistic view and understanding of the entire development process.

# Introduction To Programming 9hp
## Course Description 
The course aims to provide the student with fundamental knowledge in structured programming, including program design and implementation through imperative programming in C/C++. This course is organized and assessed through a combination of an exam and laboratory assignments. The laboratory component of the course encompasses a series of practical assignments, affording students valuable hands-on experience and an avenue to put into practice the theoretical insights acquired during the lectures.

The course includes the following topics:
- Problem-solving with stepwise refinement
- Program structures (sequence, selection, iteration)
- Built-in and user-defined data types
- Memory allocation, pointers, and references
- Functions
- Introduction to classes and objects
- Using a debugger
- The C/C++ programming language, specifically the subset of C++ corresponding to C What distinguishes the C programming language from the subset of C++ we use in the course.

 # [Databases 6hp](https://github.com/Nazlizamanian/OnlineWebShopDatabaseSQL)
 ## Course Description 
In this course, the systems utilized included MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Upon course completion, students will have gained a comprehensive understanding of fundamental concepts related to relational databases, enabling them to proficiently model, create, and query simple databases according to specified requirements. Moreover, students will develop insight into the role of database development within the broader context of system and business development. The course encompasses the following key topics:
- Relational databases and their theoretical foundations
- Database design using entity/relationship modeling
- Normalization theory
- Query languages
- Databases in the system development life cycle
- Transaction management
