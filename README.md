The education is largely based on projects and exercises that provide practical experience of the techniques being taught. Projects can span across multiple courses: in one course, you might build a user interface for a mobile app, then in the next course, construct its data storage, and in a third course, work on its network functionality. This approach offers a holistic view and understanding of the entire development process.
