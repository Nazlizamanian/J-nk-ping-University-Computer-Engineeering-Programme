# Jönköping University Computer Engineeering Programme

## About the programme
The first year of the program is primarily dedicated to foundational courses in programming, aimed at providing students with a fundamental basic understanding of both programming and mathematics. The second year is centered around the specialization in software development and mobile platforms.
The education is largely based on projects and exercises that provide practical experience of the techniques being taught. Projects can span across multiple courses: in one course, you might build a user interface for a mobile app, then in the next course, construct its data storage, and in a third course, work on its network functionality. This approach offers a holistic view and understanding of the entire development process.

## Datastructures and Algorithms 7.5hp TDSK17
### Course Description
Advanced computer programs almost always make use of certain fundamental data structures (stacks, queues, hash tables, etc.). A programmer must, therefore, be well-acquainted with these data structures. They must understand how they work, what performance they offer, and how they can be utilized by programs solving complex problems. This course aims to address this need while providing students with the opportunity to practice their previously acquired knowledge in C/C++ and deepen their understanding of structured programming. The course covers the most fundamental data structures in computer science and the algorithms used to store and retrieve data from these structures.
